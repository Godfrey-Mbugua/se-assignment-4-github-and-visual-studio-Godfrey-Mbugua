      4.Code and Project Files:
•	Organize your project files logically.

Version Control with Git:
1.	Install Git:
o	Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
2.	Initialize Git Repository:
o	Navigate to your project directory and run:
       3 . Add Files to Repository
      4 . Commit Changes:
Commit your changes with a message
       5.Connect to GitHub Repository:
           Add a remote repository
      6 Push Changes to GitHub:
Push your local commits to GitHub
Eg: git init
       git add .
      git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   git push -u origin main

3)	Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers? Branching and Merging in GitHub:
Ans: Version control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It’s crucial for software development as it allows developers to track and manage changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain a history of all modifications.
GitHub builds on Git by providing a web-based interface and additional features that enhance version control and collaboration: Remote Repositories, Collaboration Tools, Branch Management, Access Control and Permissions and Integration with CI/CD Tools.

Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git that GitHub facilitates with its user-friendly interface:
Creating Branches:
•	Branches allow you to diverge from the main codebase to work on new features or fixes without affecting the stable code.
Code; ‘git branch feature-branch’
           ‘git checkout feature-branch’
Pushing Branches to GitHub:
•	After creating and committing changes locally, push the branch to GitHub:
Code; git push -u origin feature-branch
Creating a Pull Request (PR):
•	On GitHub, navigate to the repository and click Compare & pull request to create a PR. This initiates a review process where team members can discuss and review the changes.
Code Review and Discussion:
•	Team members can review the pull request, leave comments, suggest changes, and approve or request modifications.
 Merging Branches:
•	Once the pull request is approved, it can be merged into the main branch. GitHub provides various merge strategies.
Code; git checkout main
          git pull origin main
          git merge feature-branch
Resolving Conflicts:
•	Conflicts may occur if changes in different branches overlap. GitHub highlights conflicts in the pull request, and developers resolve them by editing the conflicting files and committing the resolved changes.
Deleting Branches:
•	After merging, branches can be safely deleted to keep the repository clean.
Code; git branch -d feature-branch
          git push origin --delete feature-branch

4)	What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important?
Ans; In GitHub, branches are separate lines of development that allow you to work on different features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase.
Why Branches Are Important in GitHub:
1.	Isolation of Work:
o	Branches enable developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. This isolation prevents the introduction of unstable or unfinished code into the production environment.
2.	Parallel Development:
o	Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously. Each developer can create a branch for their work, making it easier to manage and integrate their changes without conflicts.
3.	Experimentation:
o	Branches allow for experimentation with new ideas or technologies without risking the stability of the main code. If an experiment fails, the branch can be discarded without affecting the main codebase.
4.	Code Review and Collaboration:
o	Branches facilitate code reviews and collaboration. Developers can create pull requests to propose changes in a branch, allowing others to review, discuss, and approve the code before merging it into the main branch.
5.	Version Control and History:
o	Each branch has its own commit history, making it easier to track changes specific to that branch. This history helps in understanding the evolution of features or fixes over time.
6.	Feature Management:
o	Branches are useful for managing features independently. For instance, a new feature can be developed on a dedicated branch, tested, and reviewed before being merged into the main codebase.
Basic Workflow with Branches in GitHub;
   Creating a Branch.
   Making Changes.
   Creating a Pull Request.
   Review and Merge.
   Deleting a Branch.

5)	What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request. GitHub Actions:

Ans; A pull request in GitHub is a request to merge one branch into another, typically from a feature branch into the main branch. It is a fundamental part of the collaborative workflow, enabling developers to review, discuss, and integrate code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.

How Pull Requests Facilitate Code Reviews and Collaboration:
1.	Code Review:
o	Pull requests allow team members to review changes line by line, providing feedback and comments directly on the code.
2.	Discussion and Feedback:
o	Developers can discuss proposed changes in the pull request comments, making it easy to resolve issues and clarify implementation details.
3.	Approval Workflow:
o	Pull requests can be approved or requested for changes by reviewers, ensuring that only reviewed and approved code is merged into the main branch.
4.	Integration Testing:
o	Automated tests and CI/CD workflows can be run as part of the pull request, ensuring that new changes do not break the build or introduce bugs.
5.	Documentation and Context:
o	The pull request description and commit messages provide context and documentation for the changes, making it easier for others to understand the purpose and impact of the modifications.
Steps to Create and Review a Pull Request:
Creating a Pull Request:
1.	Push Changes to a Branch
2.	Open a Pull Request.
3.	Describe Your Changes.
4.	Submit the Pull Request.
Reviewing a Pull Request:
